The beginging 
===========

so this is it 
-------
The last project I think i will do for this period of life. 

The Ant project is something :

+ to make one simple idea possible, or come true.
+ to explore a new way to do things 
+ something teaches me about project construction and take care of 

And as is always my hope, just tell the computer what i need, as
how to do it, leave it to computer.

And *Ant* is exactly one project for this purpose.
