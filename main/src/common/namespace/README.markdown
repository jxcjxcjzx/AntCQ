namespace lib dir 
===

 now namespace comes here, fully support! 

why is this lib needed ?

well, just becuase if introduced, 

* there is no need to worry about the local-global 
 difference between variables anymore.
* next time when using namespace or require, just feel free, and think in the way which should be.
